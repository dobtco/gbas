# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      title: The Innovation
      content_html: |-
        GBAS 2.0 expects to launch by September 2016 and include external applicants
        and promotions for federal staff. The team is working to secure HHS-wide
        integrated IT tools to manage the process from hiring through deployment,
        including:  tracking applications, scheduling and implementing competency-based
        assessments, global program position registration, front-loading medical
        and security clearances, and bidding for, and paneling of, position assignments.
        These integrated tools should synchronize processes with USAStaffing,
        including training materials for users.
    project_plan:
      title: Project Plan & Scope
      content_html: |-
        GBAS will strengthen HHSâ€™s capacity to meet expanding public health security,
        protection, product safety, and research mandates, by reducing the frequency
        and duration of vacancies, gaining efficiencies through batching applications,
        assessments, bidding, selection, clearances, and training for international
        assignments across HHS, while building a pool of vetted staff ready to accept
        positions when vacancies arise.

        <strong>Global Bidding & Assignment System (GBAS):</strong>
        The current system to recruit, maintain, and deploy a specialized global
        public health workforce is not flexible enough to meet the expanding global
        mandates of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Global
        Bidding and Assignment System (GBAS), a specialized system for global recruitment,
        assessment, bidding, training, and assignment, has shown early promise during its pilot.
        GBAS is filling overseas global public health vacancies, developing a pool of
        qualified and cleared staff ready for deployment, providing additional staffing
        options for programs, while building a unifying workforce strategy across the
        Department.  The project is a joint effort of pooled resources from across the Department.
